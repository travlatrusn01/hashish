# hashish

Peer-to-peer hash cracking platform.

## Introduction

**hashish** is an open-source, peer-to-peer hash cracking platform for pentesters and personal, unrecoverable passwords.

## Scope

Due to the rise of quantum computing, there is now an urge for implementation of stricter encryption algorithms, and to inspire people to stop using short passwords without numbers, uppercase/lowercase letters, and/or special characters.

The aim of this project is to save as much CPU as possible, and to replace paid hash-cracking services with an open-source, peer-to-peer platform.
